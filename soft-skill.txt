---->A language barrier is any linguistic limitation that creates confusion or prevents comprehension. 
      A barrier could refer to national and cultural languages but may also include specialized knowledge or 
     speech impairments. Whatever the source of the problem, it's crucial to identify language barriers and manage them.



Impromptu Speech
--->An impromptu speech is a speech that is given without any advance preparation or planning.
  It is typically a spontaneous response to a situation or prompt, and requires the speaker to think quickly and speak off the cuff.

   Here is an example of an impromptu speech:

   Imagine that you are at a social gathering and someone asks you to say a few words about your recent trip to Europe.
   You had not planned to give a speech, but you decide to take the opportunity to share your experiences with the group.
   You begin by thanking the person for their interest, and then proceed to talk about the highlights of your trip.
   You describe the beautiful sights you saw, the interesting people you met, and the delicious food you tasted.
   You also share some funny stories and interesting insights from your travels. You conclude by thanking the audience 
   for listening, and invite them to ask questions or share their own travel experiences. This impromptu speech is a
   spontaneous response to the request to speak, and requires you to think on your feet and speak without any preparation.

    practical and well-researched in order to make timely evidence-based recommendations.
