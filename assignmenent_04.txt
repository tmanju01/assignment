(1)What is JQuery?
--->jQuery is a small, light-weight and fast JavaScript library. It is cross-platform and supports
   different types of browsers. It is also referred as ?write less do more? because it takes a lot of
   common tasks that requires many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and binds them into methods 
   that can be called with a single line of code whenever needed. It is also very useful to simplify a lot
   of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

(2)How to Apply CSS Using JQuery, How to Add Class and Remove Class in JQuery,JQuery Animation? 
--->

     It is possible to change the CSS property of an element by using a simple JavaScript API, but we
      try to complete this challenge using jQuery css() method.  

     Syntax:

        $().css(propertyname, value);
        $().css(properties);
    There are many types of CSS methods, which means that each method has the same name but takes different
    parameters. We will discuss only two methods, one of which is used to change a single CSS property, while
    the other is used to change multiple CSS properties simultaneously. With the second method, you can pass a
    JSON string object as a parameter that you want to apply to the HTML element. 


    -The addClass() or removeClass() methods are used to add the CSS classes when there is a need to add 
      to our webpage when there is some event listener or to create some kind of effect.

    In this article, let us see how can we add a CSS class or remove a CSS class in jQuery.

    Syntax:

     Adding a class:
     $('selector').addClass(class_name);
     Removing a class:
     $('selector').removeClass(class_name);


    -The jQuery animate() method provides you a way to create custom animations.

    Syntax:

     $(selector).animate({params}, speed, callback);  
     Here, params parameter defines the CSS properties to be animated.

     The speed parameter is optional and specifies the duration of the effect. It can be set as "slow" ,
     "fast" or milliseconds.

     The callback parameter is also optional and it is a function which is executed after the animation
     completes.
