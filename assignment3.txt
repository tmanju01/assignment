MODULE: 2 (CSS and CSS 3)


(1)What are the benefits of using CSS? 
--->CSS plays an important role, by using CSS you simply got to specify a repeated style for element once 
    & use it multiple times as because CSS will automatically apply the required styles.

    -The main advantage of CSS is that style is applied consistently across variety of sites.
    One instruction can control several areas which is advantageous.

   -Web designers needs to use few lines of programming for every page improving site speed.

   -Cascading sheet not only simplifies website development, but also simplifies the maintenance 
    as a change of one line of code affects the whole web site and maintenance time.

   -It is less complex therefore the effort are significantly reduced.
   -It helps to form spontaneous and consistent changes.

   -CSS changes are device friendly. With people employing a batch of various range of smart
    devices to access websites over the web, there’s a requirement for responsive web design.

   -It has the power for re-positioning. It helps us to determine the changes within
    the position of web elements who are there on the page.

    -These bandwidth savings are substantial figures of insignificant tags that are indistinct 
     from a mess of pages.

     -Easy for the user to customize the online page
      -It reduces the file transfer size.

(2)What are the disadvantages of CSS? 
--->CSS, CSS 1 up to CSS3, result in creating of confusion among  web browsers.

   -With CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with another. The
   web developers need to test for compatibility, running the program across multiple browsers.

   -There exists a scarcity of security.
   -After making the changes we need to confirm the compatibility if they appear. 
    The similar change affects on all the browsers.

    -The programing language world is complicated for non-developers and beginners. Different 
     levels of CSS i.e. CSS, CSS 2, CSS 3 are often quite confusing.

    -Browser compatibility (some styles sheet are supported and some are not).
     CSS works differently on different browsers. IE and Opera supports CSS as different logic.

    -There might be cross-browser issues while using CSS.
     -There are multiple levels which creates confusion for non-developers and beginners.

(3)What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?
--->CSS3 is split into many various documents known as Modules. each module 
    adds new capability or extends options outlined in CSS2 over conserving backward compatibility. Work on 
    CSS3 started around the time of publication of the initial CSS2 recommendation.

    -The CSS3 version supports more browsers than CSS2.
   -CSS3 introduces several new selectors. Those new selectors square measure largely in an 
    exceeding type of pseudo-elements and pseudo-categories.
   
    -The new addition of General relation Combinator will be wont to match relation parts
      of a given part through diacritic (~) combinator.

     -CSS3 introduces several properties attended with new values and units.
      It facilitates styling of backgrounds, borders, boxes, etc…, that permits the 
      USA to stay most of the styling at intervals the computer network and HTML standards and our document, 
      while not a necessity for all those proprietary third-party package packages.

       -New values and new units square measure introduced to support all those new properties. for example,
       Angle units deg, grad, rad, and switch or Time units s and ms


(4) Name a few CSS style components?
--->The first part of a CSS rule is the selector - this encapsulates the set of elements to which the 
      rule applies. Typically this will be an ID selector - #element-id, a class selector - .class-name,
     an element selector - div/section/whatever, or something more complex involving hierarchy or location -
    :first-child perhaps.

     -Next, enclosed within a pair of curly braces, comes the rule-set. This is one or more rules
      which apply a particular style to the element(s) matched by the selector.

(5)What do you understand by CSS opacity?
--->The CSS opacity property is used to specify the transparency of an element. In simple word, 
    you can say that it specifies the clarity of the image.

    -In technical terms, Opacity is defined as degree in which light is allowed to travel through an object.


(6)How can the background color of an element be changed?
--->You can change the background color of an HTML element using the background-color CSS property 
    and giving it a value of a color.

        p {
             background-color: pink;
          }
           With this code, the paragraphs are given a pink background.
   For example, this code will make all paragraph elements in your
   HTML file have a pink background because the
   background-color property has a value of pink.


(7)How can image repetition of the backup be controlled? 
--->we will see how an image repetition of the backup is controlled in CSS.
    This task can be achieved by using the background-repeat property that will help 
     us to control the repetition of the image.

    -The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image
      both horizontally and vertically. It also decides whether the background image will be repeated or not.

   Syntax:

            background-repeat: repeat|repeat-x|repeat-y|no-repeat|initial|inherit;

(8)What is the use of the background-position property? 
--->The background-position property in CSS is mainly used to sets the initial
     position for the background image ie., it is used to set an image at a certain 
     position. The position that is relative to the positioning layer, can be set by using
     the background-origin property.

   Syntax:

        background-position: value;

    background-position: left top;: This property is used to set the image at the left top.   

(9)Which property controls the image scroll in the background? 
---> we will discuss the property that is used to control the scrolling of an 
     image in the background. The background-attachment property in CSS is used to 
     specify the kind of attachment of the background image with respect to its container.
     It can be set to scroll or make it remain fixed. It can be applied to all HTML elements.


    Syntax:

       background-attachment: scroll|fixed|local|initial|inherit;

(10)Why should background and color be used as separate properties? 
---> The background property is a complex property in CSS, and if it is 
      combined with color, the complexity will further increase.
      Color is an inherited property while the background is not.

(11)How to center block elements using CSS1?
--->To center the block-level elements, we need to set the margin-right
     and margin-left properties to explicit values.

(12)How to maintain the CSS specifications? 
--->The Specification defines how CSS properties should be implemented by browser
     vendors along with detailed algorithms, code samples and tabular information.

    The Specification also include:

          The syntax and data types of the language
          Detailed explanation on CSS Selectors
          How you can assign values to properties
          The Cascade (the "C" in CSS)
          How inheritance works
          The Box Model e.t.c

       -The CSS Specification prior to CSS3 was a single Specification, CSS3 on
        the other hand is divided into Modules which are Independent Specifications that 
        can be worked on by different author(s) at different paces, that's why we have Selector
        Level 3 Specification, CSS Color 4, CSS Backgrounds and so on. Some of these modules are 
        revisions of CSS2.1, and some are newly created, but all fall under the banner of CSS3.


(13)What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page? 
--->There are lots of websites available over the web with ideal elements.
    Visitors focus on different matters to visit the website and gain a fantastic 
    experience. Style and interaction allow a website to stand from the rest.
    A web page with proper technique is easy to display on the browser. 
    Style plays an essential role in building a well-designed site.
    Cascading style sheets are the most popular web markup language.

    -It is a suitable asset for web designers and developers to improve the
     overall appearance and look. CSS is an excellent choice for professionals to 
    define layout, style, and position components. If you want to add style to the 
    web page, you can opt for CSS. You may also work with reputable experts well-known 
     in the language. The browser reads the style sheet and arranges the page as per codes in files.

(14)What is embedded style sheets? 
---> It allows you to define styles for a particular HTML document as a whole in 
    one place. This is done by embedding the <style></style> tags containing the CSS
    properties in the head of your document.Embedded style sheets are particularly 
   useful for HTML documents that have unique style requirements from the rest of the
   documents in your project. However, if the styles need to be applied across multiple
   documents, you should link to an external style sheet instead of using individual embedded 
   style sheets. Using embedded stylesheets holds a distinct advantage over inline styles which
   only allow you to address one HTML element at a time. 

        Syntax: The CSS syntax for embedded style sheets is exactly the same as other CSS code,
                apart from the fact that it is now wrapped within the <style></style> tags. The <style>
                tag takes the ‘type’ attribute that defines the type of style sheet being used (ie. text/CSS). 

(15)What are the external style sheets?
--->An external style sheet is a separate file where you can declare all the styles
   that you want to use on your website. You then link to the
   external style sheet from all your HTML pages.

   -This means you only need to set the styles for each element once. If you want to
    update the style of your website, you only need to do it in one place.

    -Type CSS code into a plain text file, and save with a .css extension (for example, styles.css).
    -Add the following code between the <head></head> tags of all HTML documents that you want to
     reference the external style sheet. This code uses the HTML <link> element to link to the
      external style sheet.

         <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

(16)What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets? 
--->
   The advantages of External Style Sheets are:

      - Using them, the styles of multiple documents can be controlled from one file.
      - Classes can be created for use on multiple HTML element types in many documents.
      - In complex situations, selector and grouping methods can be used to apply styles.

   The disadvantages of External Style Sheets are:

     - In order to import style information for each document, an extra download is needed.
     - Until the external style sheet is loaded, it may not be possible to render the document.
     - For small number of style definitions, it is not viable.

(17)What is the meaning of the CSS selector? 
--->There are several different types of selectors:

     type selectors – matching a specific element
     class selectors – matching elements with a specific class
     ID selectors – matching the element with a specific ID
     descendant selectors – matching elements that are descendants of a specific element
     child selectors – matching elements that are a child of the specific element
     universal selectors – matching any element
     adjacent sibling selectors – matching elements immediately preceded by a specific element
     attribute selectors – matching elements with a specific attribute or attribute value
     pseudo-class selectors – matching elements with a specific pseudo-class
     pseudo-element selectors – matching elements with specific pseudo-element properties


(18)What are the media types allowed by CSS? 
--->                            Media Type               	Description
                                  all	           Used for all media type devices
                                  aural        	   Used for speech and sound synthesizers
                                  braille	    Used for braille tactile feedback devices
                                  embossed	    Used for paged braille printers
                                 handheld	    Used for small or handheld devices
                                   print	    Used for printers
                                  projection	    Used for projected presentations, like slides
                                  screen	            Used for computer screens
                                   tty	            Used for media using a fixed-pitch character grid, like teletypes and terminals
                                  tv	            Used for television-type devices

(19)What is the rule set? 
--->A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector points to the HTML element you want to style. The declaration 
    block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
