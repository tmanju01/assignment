(2)How to embed audio and video in a webpage? 
---->Audio and video can help to add interactive content to your website.
     Good part is that HTML5 offers easy way to embed audio and video files. 
     It has a default player and most modern browsers support HTML player. In this article,
     we will explain how to embed audio and video files using HTML5.

        Audio

      To embed audio in HTML, we use the <audio> tag. Before HTML5, audio cannot be 
      added to web pages in the Internet Explorer era. To play audio, we used web plugins like Flash.
     After the release of HTML5, it is possible. This tag supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge in three
     audio formats – MP3, WAV, OGG. Only Safari browser doesn’t support OGG audio format.

      Syntax:
      <audio>
           <source src="file_name" type="audio_file_type">
      </audio>


      Video

    
       To embed video in HTML, we use the <video> tag. It contains one or more video sources
       at a time using <source> tag. It supports MP4, WebM, and Ogg 
       in all modern browsers. Only Ogg video format doesn’t support in Safari browser. 

     
      Syntax:

   
      <video>
         <source src="file_name" type="video_file_type">
      </video>


(3)Semantic element in HTML5? 
--->Semantic Elements: Semantic elements have meaningful names which tells about type of content.
     For example header, footer, table, … etc. HTML5 introduces many semantic elements as mentioned 
     below which make the code easier to write and understand for the developer as well as instructs the browser on how to treat them. 
 

    - article
    - aside
    - details
    - figcaption
    - figure
    - footer
    - header
    - main
    - mark
    - nav
    - section

(4)Canvas and SVG tags.
--->
     Canvas

    HTML5 element <canvas> gives you an easy and powerful way to draw graphics using JavaScript. It can be used to draw graphs,
    make photo compositions or do simple (and not so simple) animations.

    Here is a simple <canvas> element which has only two specific attributes width and height plus all
    the core HTML5 attributes like id, name and class, etc
   
    <canvas id = "mycanvas" width = "100" height = "100"></canvas>

    You can easily find that <canvas> element in the DOM using getElementById() method as follows −

     var canvas = document.getElementById("mycanvas");


    SVG

 
    SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics and it is a language for describing 2D-graphics 
    and graphical applications in XML and the XML is then rendered by an SVG viewer.

    SVG is mostly useful for vector type diagrams like Pie charts, Two-dimensional graphs in an X,Y coordinate system etc.

   Embedding SVG in HTML5

    HTML5 allows embedding SVG directly using <svg>...</svg> tag which has following simple syntax −

       <svg xmlns = "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

           ...    
       </svg>
