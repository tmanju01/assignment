(2)What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work? 
--->Bootstrap Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap. Bootstrap Containers are very 
    essential and basic building blocks of bootstrap that wrap a page’s content. It’s responsible for 
    setting and aligning content within it according to viewport or given device. Containers are defined 
    within the container class (.container). In other words, we can say that containers are established the
     width for the layout to give the content. Elements and content are added within the container.

    Containers are used for many purposes such as –

     It requires use with the default grid system.
     To establish width for the layout to give web content.
     To provide responsive fixed behavior of any web project.
     To sets the content margin dealing with the responsive behavior of your layout.

(3)What are the default Bootstrap text settings? 
--->Bootstrap's Default Settings Bootstrap's global default font-size is 14px, with a line-height of 1.428.
     This is applied to the element and all paragraphs ( ).

(4)What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?
--->Grid systems are used for creating page layouts through a series of rows and columns that house your 
    content. Here's how the Bootstrap grid system works −

    Rows must be placed within a .container class for proper alignment and padding.

    Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns.

    Content should be placed within the columns, and only columns may be the immediate children of rows.

    Predefined grid classes like .row and .col-xs-4 are available for quickly making grid layouts.
    LESS mixins can also be used for more semantic layouts.

    Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding. That padding is offset in rows for the 
    first and the last column via negative margin on .rows.

    Grid columns are created by specifying the number of twelve available columns you wish to span. For 
    example, three equal columns would use three .col-xs-4.

(7)How can you use Bootstrap to make thumbnails?
--->A lot of sites need a way to lay out images, videos, text, etc, in a grid, and Bootstrap has an easy 
    way to do this with thumbnails. To create thumbnails using Bootstrap −

    Add an <a> tag with the class of .thumbnail around an image.

    This adds four pixels of padding and a gray border.

    On hover, an animated glow outlines the image.

    Adding Custom Content

      Now that we have a basic thumbnail, it's possible to add any kind of HTML content like headings, paragraphs, 
      or buttons into thumbnails. Follow the steps below −

      Change the <a> tag that has a class of .thumbnail to a <div>.

      Inside of that <div>, you can add anything you need. As this is a <div>, we can use the default span-based
      naming convention for sizing.

      If you want to group multiple images, place them in an unordered list, and each list item will be floated
      to the left.
